# Frontend Application

## Overview

This `frontend` folder is designated for the frontend application of your technical assessment project. You are expected to create a Next.js application that will serve as the user interface for the backend services developed in NestJs.

The frontend should be inspired by an existing open-source repository with a focus on scientific discussions. Your task is to replicate the UI from the reference repository and make necessary adjustments to integrate it with the NestJs backend using GraphQL.

## Technical Assessment Details

For more information about the technical assessment and what is expected, please refer to the assessment documentation:
[Technical Assessment Instructions](https://github.com/Thinkable-AI/Technical-Assessment-Starter/blob/main/README.md)

## Getting Started

### Development

- Develop the frontend application following best practices in web development.
- Ensure that the UI components are reusable and well-organized.
- Integrate the frontend with the GraphQL API provided by the NestJs backend.
- Test the application to ensure that it communicates correctly with the backend and displays data as expected.

### Enhancements _(optional)_

- While you should start by replicating the UI from the reference repository, you are encouraged to make enhancements and improvements to the design and user experience.
- Consider accessibility, performance, and responsiveness in your enhancements.

### Reference Repository

- Use the following open-source repository as a reference for your UI design and structure: [gpt4-pdf-chatbot-langchain](https://github.com/mayooear/gpt4-pdf-chatbot-langchain)

### Integration

- Modify the frontend application to interact with the GraphQL API endpoints of your NestJs backend.
- Use Apollo Client or a similar library to manage GraphQL operations and state management on the client side.

### Best Practices

- Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.
- Follow the component structure and file organization conventions of Next.js.
- Use environment variables for any sensitive information or configuration that varies between environments.

## Documentation

- Include a README file in the `frontend` directory with instructions on how to run and build the frontend application.
- Document any assumptions, design decisions, and enhancements you make.

## Submission

- Ensure that the frontend application is fully functional and integrates seamlessly with the backend.
- Test your application thoroughly before submission.
